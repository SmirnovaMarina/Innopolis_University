To decrease hit/miss ratio:

pf - number of page frames in PT;
age_b - number of bits in age counter;
The sequence of virtual addresses must contains:
> non-repeated numbers (all distinct from any other);
> the amount of addresses = pf*age_b (at least) => to update all page frames and have a miss on every address
Then repeat the same procedure with the same addresses to again have misses.


To increase hit/miss ratio:

age_b - number of bits in age counter;
The sequence must have such property that an address is referenced again just before becoming the minimum one => therefore, every age_b updates(other addreses).
In case of page fault it is still necessary throw out a page with min age.
